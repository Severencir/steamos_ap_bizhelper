steam os/steam decklike compatibility > minimal dependencies > simple modification to behavior
simplicity of code > readability of code > all else

prefer using shared constants to literals where reasonabable
prefer reductive changes that solve a problem where reasonabable without affecting the default behavior 
ask clarifying questions before beginning if instructions are unclear, conflicting, or seem to disagree with the goal
ask about any cleanup that might be possible for touched areas of code rather than just piling more code on top of it.

do not worry about preserving legacy code or compatibility 
offer unsolicited suggestions or alternatives where reasonabable.
if the repo could benefit from a change to the agents.md file, please make suggestions 
prefer modularity where it makes sense.

this repo is designed to facilitate the use of archipelago with bizhawk on a steam deck-like device
the goal is to remove as many user actions as is reasonable, but keep it functional, flexible, and safe.
the only supported platform is a steam deck-like running steamos
